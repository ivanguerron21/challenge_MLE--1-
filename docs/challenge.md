Note: Some dependencies were updated since proposed versions were giving errors.

### Part I

- The model passes the tests by running `make model-test`.
(Some small changes were made for the jupyter file).
Worked with the given parameters, although adding some to the constructor and functions would have made a more generalizable and smooth code.

### Part II


- The `API` passes the tests by running `make api-test`.


### Part III

Deployed on google cloud run service
- The `API` passes the tests by running `make stress-test`.

### Part IV

`CI/CD` implementation for this development.

CD deploys and CI tests.

FUN NOTE: Today my flight got delayed!!!
